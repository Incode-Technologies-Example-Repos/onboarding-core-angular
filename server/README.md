# Example Token Server Using NodeJS

## Endpoints

- GET `/start`: Call Incode's `/omni/start` API to create an Incode session which will include a `token` in the JSON response. This token can be shared with Incode SDK client apps to do token based initialization, which is a best practice.

It also performs basic storage of sessions in the `sessions` directory to help implement `renderRedirectToMobile`in frontend.

At session generation it will generate an `uniqueId` and save the session in `session/<uniqueId>.json`, later if you call `/start` again passing a valid `uniqueId` it will retrieve the stored session instead of creating a new one.

- GET `/onboarding-url`: Calls incodes `/omni/start` and then with the token calls `/0/omni/onboarding-url` to retrieve the unique onboarding-url for the newly created session.

- GET `/onboarding-status`: Calls incodes `/omni/get/onboarding/status` API and return the onboarding status.

Expects `interviewId` as query param.

- GET `/fetch-score`: Calls incodes `/omni/get/score` API and return the score.

Expects `interviewId` as query param.

- POST `/auth`: Receives the information about a faceMatch attempt and verifies if it was correct and has not been tampered.

- POST `/webhook`: Example webhook that reads the json data and return it back a response, from here you could fetch scores or OCR data when the status is ONBOARDING_FINISHED

- POST `/approve`: Example webhook that reads the json data and if the status is ONBOARDING_FINISHED goes ahead and creates the identity using the `/omni/process/approve` endpoint.

## Secure Credential Handling
We highly recommend to follow the 0 rule for your implementations, where all sensitive calls to incode's endpoints are done in the backend, keeping your apikey protected and just returning a `token` with the user session to the frontend.

Within this sample you will find the only calls to a `/omni/` endpoints we recommend for you to have, it requires the usage of the `apikey`, all further calls must be done using only the generated `token` and be addresed to the `/0/omni` endpoints. 

## Prerequisites
This sample uses the global fetch API so you must use [Node 18](https://nodejs.org/en) or higher.

## Local Development

### Environment
Rename `sample.env` file to `.env` adding your subscription information:

```env
API_URL=https://demo-api.incodesmile.com
API_KEY=you-api-key
FLOW_ID=Flow or Workflow Id from your Incode dashboard.
ADMIN_TOKEN=Needed for the webhooks to be able to fetch Scores and auto-approve
```

### Using NPM
Install the depencies with `npm install` 
```bash
npm install
```

Then start the local server with the nodemon script, it will keep an eye on file changes and restart the local server if needed.
```bash
npm run nodemon
```

The server will accept petitions on `http://localhost:3000/`

### Using Docker

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose --env-file ./.env up
```

The server will accept petitions on `http://localhost:3000/`

### Frontend development

For development most of our frontend samples have a reverse proxy configured to serve `http://localhost:3000/` on `https://<your-ip>:5731/api`

That way you avoid all problems related to CORS.

### Webhook development

For our systems to reach your server, you will need to expose the server to the internet with ngrok

For your frontend to properly work in tandem with this server on your mobile phone for testing, you will need a public url with proper SSL configured, by far the easiest way to acchieve this with an ngrok account properly configured on your computer. You can visit `https://ngrok.com` to make a free account and do a quick setup.

Then simply run the nodemon script, it will start the server in port 3000 and restart whenever a file is changed, leave it running.

```bash
npm run nodemon
```

In another shell expose the server to internet through your computer ngrok account:

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Open the `Forwarding` adress in a web browser. The URL should look similar to this: `https://466c-47-152-68-211.ngrok-free.app`.

Now you should be able to visit the following routes to receive the associated payloads:
1. `https://yourforwardingurl.app/start`
2. `https://yourforwardingurl.app/start?uniqueId=0e810732-6e7e-4512-aaa5-1ae2e1f8df46`
3. `https://yourforwardingurl.app/onboarding-url`
4. `https://yourforwardingurl.app/onboarding-url?redirectionUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2F`

## Post Endpoints

### Auth
Receives the information about a faceMatch attempt and verifies if it was correct and has not been tampered.

All the parameters needed come as the result of execution of the [Render Login](https://docs.incode.com/docs/web/integration-guide/sdk-methods#renderlogin) component,
you can see a full example of it's usage in [Face Login Sample](https://github.com/Incode-Technologies-Example-Repos/javascript-samples/tree/main/face-login)

```bash
curl --location 'https://yourforwardingurl.app/auth' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "transactionId": "Transaction Id obtained at face login",
    "token": "Token obtained at face login ",
    "interviewToken": "Interview token obtained at face login",
}'
```

## Webhooks

### Simplified Webhook
`https://yourforwardingurl.app/webhook`
We provide an example on how to read the data we send in the webhook calls, from here you could
fetch scores and OCR data, what you do with that is up to you.

### Auto approve on PASS
`https://yourforwardingurl.app/approve`
We provide a more complex example where we fetch the scores and if the status is `OK` we then
approve the user to create his identity for face-login

### Admin Token
For the approval and fetching of scores to work you will need an Admin Token, Admin tokens
require an executive user-password and have a 24 hour expiration, thus need a
more involved strategy to be generated, renewed, securely saved and shared to the app.

For this simple test just use the following cURl, and add the generated token to the `.env` file,
you will need to refresh it after 24 hours.

```bash
curl --location 'https://demo-api.incodesmile.com/executive/log-in' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'api-version: 1.0' \
--header 'x-api-key: <your-apikey>' \
--data '{
    "email": "••••••",
    "password": "••••••"
}'
```

### How to test your code
To recreate the call and the format of the data sent by Incode you can use the following script:

```bash
curl --location 'https://yourforwardingurl.app/webhook' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "interviewId": "<interviewId>",
    "onboardingStatus": "ONBOARDING_FINISHED",
    "clientId": "<clientId>",
    "flowId": "<flowId>"
}'
```
